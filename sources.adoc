== The Agile Manifesto

Brief Introduction
There are many software development methods. And today we want to talk about Agile. We will give a brief and concise historical context so you understand how and why it was developed. We will then proceed to reveal you the core ideas behind it, and showing you that is not a specific framework but more a set of principles that have evolved into several development methods. And that this principles were set and diffused by the Agile Manifesto.


=== Context

Before the term "Agile Methods" was coined, software development was primarily based on the traditional Waterfall Model, where development was viewed as a sequential and rigid process. This approach faced challenges in delivering quality software that met customers' changing needs and expectations.

The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 by a group of software developers and project managers in response to the limitations of traditional development methods. The manifesto was written during a meeting in Snowbird, Utah, where the participants discussed and agreed upon a set of values and principles for software development.

The Agile Manifesto consists of four values: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

New development methodologies were needed because traditional approaches failed to deliver software that met customers' changing needs and expectations. Agile methodologies were designed to be flexible, adaptive, and responsive to change, allowing software development teams to deliver high-quality software in a fast-paced and rapidly changing market.

.The Agile Manifesto

[.text-center]
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

*Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

*Working software* over comprehensive documentation

*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

*Responding to change* over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

.12 Priciples
--
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

== Major Concepts

.Definition
|===
|Concept | Definition

|Test Driven Development
|Software development methodology where tests are written before any code is written. The process involves writing a test that defines the desired behavior of a small piece of code, writing just enough implementation code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code to ensure its quality. The cycle is repeated for every feature, resulting in a codebase that is well-tested and supported by automated tests.

|Continuous Integration
|Software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day. With CI, every change made to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and validated to detect any integration problems as early as possible. The goal of CI is to reduce the risk of integration problems and provide quick feedback to developers.

|Continuous Development
|Extension of CI that automates the deployment process of code changes from development to production. Every change made to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production, without manual intervention. The goal of CD is to reduce the time between writing code and delivering it to end-users, and to increase the speed and reliability of the software delivery process.

== Historical context 
What was used before?
Software development methods can be traced back to the 1940’s. And iterative methods to the 1950´s. The traditional approach was a very linear one, the requirements were defined, then designed, and it would afterwards be implemented. Then some testing would be done and maintenance if needed. This whole paradigm was inherited from Civil or Mechanical Engineering, where changing the final product would be way too expensive. The issue is that the client could not see and approve the software until the very end, and hence would be unable to see if it fulfilled all the requirements. This kind of method is called "Waterfall" or "Cascade". And some other issues can arise during development as the project being way too micromanaged, or difficulties appearing in the programming stage that cannot be foreseen in the design phase.
Even though the waterfall method was one of the most popular ones, there are several others:
-	Rapid Application Development
-	Dynamic systems development method
-	Structured systems analysis and design method
To name a few. 
But often problems arise when we need to scale to more users or add new requirements. 
By the 1990 there are several iterative methods to develop software. And in 2001 seventeen software developers met to put together and publish the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.
