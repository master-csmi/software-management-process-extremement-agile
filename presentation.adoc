Plan: 

- Why did programmers need new methods

- What is Agile

- Some common principles

== The Agile Manifesto

=== Context & Historical Backround

- Software development methods can be traced back to the 1940’s.
- The traditional approach was a very linear one, the requirements were defined, then designed, and it would afterwards be implemented. 

=== The Cascade method

- Other development methods: 
-	Rapid Application Development
-	Dynamic systems development method
-	Structured systems analysis and design method

=== The rise of iterative methods

- By the 1990 there are several iterative methods to develop software. 
- And in 2001 seventeen software developers met to put together and publish the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

=== Values

- *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

- *Responding to change* over following a plan

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.**_

=== Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

* Team work between developers and business people.

* Empower motivated individuals.

* Prefer face-to-face communication.

== Working software* over comprehensive documentation

* Measure progress with working software.

* Good design improves agility.

== Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

* Satisfy the customer -> early and continuous delivery software.

* Welcome changing requirements -> The costumers has continous
access to the product.

== Responding to change* over following a plan

* Prioritize simplicity.

* Continuously reflect and adjust for improvement.

* Agile ensures sustainable pace for all parties.

== Major Concepts

=== Test Driven Development

[.right]
image::tdd.webp[width=400]

Software development methodology where **tests are written before any code is written**.

1. Defines the **desired behavior of a small piece of code**.
2. Write code to **make the test pass**.
3. Refactor the code to **ensure its quality**.

=== Continuous Integration
Software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, typically **several times a day**. 

Every change made to the codebase is automatically:

- Built
- Tested
- Validated

=== Continuous Integration Goals

- Detect any integration problems as early as possible.
- Provide quick feedback to developers.

=== Continuous Development
Extension of CI that **automates the deployment process of code changes from development to production**. 

Every change made to the codebase is automatically:

- _Built_
- _Tested_
- _Validated_
- **Deployed**

=== Continuous Development Goals

- Reduce the time between writing code and delivering it to end-users.
- Increase the speed and reliability of the software delivery process.

=== CI/CD
