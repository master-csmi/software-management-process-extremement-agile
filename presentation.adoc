== The Agile Manifesto

=== Context

- _Hard to handle source code

- _response to the limitations and drawbacks of traditional software development methodologies such as the Waterfall model

- _Software cannot adapt to bigger servers, more users => *scalability issues*

- _Software cannot adapt to new requirements => *flexibility issues*

=== Sources

- _History : The Agile Manifesto_. (s. d.). Consulté le 27 janvier 2023, à l’adresse http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html

=== Values

- *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

- *Responding to change* over following a plan

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.**_

=== 12 Derived Principles (1/4)

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

=== 12 Derived Principles (2/4)

* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

=== 12 Derived Principles (3/4)

* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

=== 12 Derived Principles (4/4)

*  Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

== Major Concepts

=== Test Driven Development

[.right]
image::tdd.webp[width=400]

Software development methodology where **tests are written before any code is written**.

1. Defines the **desired behavior of a small piece of code**.
2. Write code to **make the test pass**.
3. Refactor the code to **ensure its quality**.

=== Continuous Integration
Software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, typically **several times a day**. 

Every change made to the codebase is automatically:

- Built
- Tested
- Validated

=== Continuous Integration Goals

- Detect any integration problems as early as possible.
- Provide quick feedback to developers.

=== Continuous Development
Extension of CI that **automates the deployment process of code changes from development to production**. 

Every change made to the codebase is automatically:

- _Built_
- _Tested_
- _Validated_
- **Deployed**

=== Continuous Development Goals

- Reduce the time between writing code and delivering it to end-users.
- Increase the speed and reliability of the software delivery process.

=== CI/CD
