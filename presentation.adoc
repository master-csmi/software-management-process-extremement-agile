== The Agile Manifesto

=== Context

- _Hard to handle source code

- _response to the limitations and drawbacks of traditional software development methodologies such as the Waterfall model

- _Software cannot adapt to bigger servers, more users => *scalability issues*

- _Software cannot adapt to new requirements => *flexibility issues*

=== Sources

- _History : The Agile Manifesto_. (s. d.). Consulté le 27 janvier 2023, à l’adresse http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html

=== Values

- *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

- *Responding to change* over following a plan

_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.**_

=== 12 Derived Principles (1/4)

* Satisfy the customer -> early and continuous delivery software.

* Welcome changing requirements -> The costumers has continous access to the product.

=== 12 Derived Principles (2/4)

* Team work between developers and business people.

* Empower motivated individuals.

* Prefer face-to-face communication.

=== 12 Derived Principles (3/4)

* Design improves agility.

* Measure progress with working software.

* Agile ensures sustainable pace for all parties.

=== 12 Derived Principles (4/4)

* Prioritize simplicity.

* Teams generate best outcomes.

* Continuously reflect and adjust for improvement.

== Major Concepts

=== Test Driven Development
Software development methodology where **tests are written before any code is written**.

The process involves writing a test that defines the **desired behavior of a small piece of code**, writing just enough implementation code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code to ensure its quality. The cycle is repeated for every feature, resulting in a codebase that is well-tested and supported by automated tests.

=== Continuous Integration
Software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day. 

With CI, **every change made to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and validated** to detect any integration problems as early as possible. The goal of CI is to reduce the risk of integration problems and provide quick feedback to developers.

=== Continuous Development
Extension of CI that **automates the deployment process of code changes from development to production**. 

Every change made to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production, without manual intervention. The goal of CD is to reduce the time between writing code and delivering it to end-users, and to increase the speed and reliability of the software delivery process.
